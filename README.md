Lexi
====

Lexi, for lexical, is a fast conversion library to and from lexical forms. Internally, Lexi uses code from Milo Yip's [dtoa and itoa](https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson) implementation for double and integer conversions, respectively, and adds type detection as well as other overloads for fast lexical conversions.
